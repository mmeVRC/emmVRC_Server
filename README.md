# emmVRC_Server

Saw this on a repo a while back and took a copy, was planning on submitting a pull request but it seems the original repo has been taken down. You can figure out what to do to get it running from the code, it's very basic and probably very hackable.

Features:

Token generation for login, removal on logout,

Messaging,

Avatar searching and storing,

Rate limits so people can't crash you with message spams,

URL checks so users can't upload avatars that link to resources outside of VRChat,

Other stuff I probably forgot.
